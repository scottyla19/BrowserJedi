#Browser Jedi

##Control your browser with a Hover Board [Hover Labs](http://www.hoverlabs.co), an Arduino, and some python.

Currently it only works on a Mac and was tested on Firefox, Crome, and Safari.

Things to do in the future:
- ensure cross-browser functionality
- develop a cross-platform version (Windows and Linux)
- allow user specified key commands instead of hard coding
