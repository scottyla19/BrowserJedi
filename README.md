#Browser Jedi

##Control your browser with a [Hover Board](http://www.hoverlabs.co), an Arduino, and some python you will.

Currently it only works on a Mac and was tested on Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.

Current Functions include:
- Swipe Up : Zoom In
- Swipe Down : Zoom Out
- Swipe Left : Go Back
- Swipe Right : Go Forward

- Tap Left: Undo
- Tap Right: Redo
- Tap Center Refresh
- Tap Down : Scroll Down a Frame
- Tap Up : Scroll Up a Frame

Things to do in the future:
- ensure cross-browser functionality
- develop a cross-platform version (Windows and Linux)
- allow user specified key commands instead of hard coding
